                    <h2>The Journey to Clean Code</h2>
                    <img src="code.png" alt="clean code" class="article-img" height= "200" width= "300">  
                    <p>Writing clean code is not just about formatting or naming variables. It's a mindset. As developers, we spend more time reading code than writing it. Clean code improves collaboration, debugging, and reduces technical debt. Start by naming things properly, keeping functions small, and applying consistent formatting. Add comments only when necessary. Remember, clean code reads like prose. Follow standards. Refactor often. And always keep the next developer in mind—you.</p>

                    <h2>Why Responsive Design Matters</h2>
                    <img src="design.jpg" alt="responsive design" class="article-img" height= "200" width= "300">
                    <p>In today's mobile-first world, responsive design is essential. A website that adapts across devices provides a better user experience and boosts engagement. From media queries to flexible grids, there are many techniques to achieve responsiveness. It's not just about layout—accessibility and performance are key. Start designing from the smallest screen upward. Test across browsers and resolutions. Responsive sites rank better on search engines too. Always think user-first, not device-first. Embrace responsiveness as a mindset, not a feature.</p>
